---------------------------------------------------------------------
A predictable state container for python *heavily* inspired by Redux_
---------------------------------------------------------------------

While not being a *strict 1:1 port* of `Redux API`_, **Revived** is supposed to
do pretty much the same job in the most pythonic way possible.

**NOTE**: I needed this piece of code to work with the latest python available
(3.6) and *I did not really care about checking for the previous versions*.
