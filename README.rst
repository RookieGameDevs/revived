revived
=======

A predictable state container for python *heavily* inspired by `redux <http://redux.js.org/>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While not being a strict 1:1 port of the `redux <http://redux.js.org/>`_ API,
**revived** is supposed to do a similar job in the most pythonic way possible.

**NOTE**: I needed this piece of code to work with the latest python (3.6) and I did
not really care about checking for the previous versions.
