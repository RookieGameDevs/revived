# revived

## A predictable state container for python *heavily* inspired by [redux](http://redux.js.org/)

While not being a strinct 1:1 port of the [redux](http://redux.js.org/) API,
**revived** is supposed to do a similar job in the most pythonic way possible.

NOTE: I needed this piece of code to work with the latest python (3.6) and I did
not really care about checking for previous versions.
